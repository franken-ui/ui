# Franken UI

Franken UI is an HTML-first UI component library built on UIkit 3 and extended with LitElement, inspired by shadcn/ui.

## Is this project dead?

Letâ€™s settle this. Just because you haven't seen recent activity doesn't mean it's abandoned. The project is **feature complete**. We've hit our goals and are now focused on maintaining stability and making gradual improvements.

### We're in for the long haul

This isnâ€™t some fly-by-night project. Iâ€™m committed to keeping it going for the long term, as long as thereâ€™s enough community support.

This is a one-person, fully independent effort. No company funding. No hidden team. No VC nonsense. Support it via **GitHub Sponsors** to help keep it going. Unfortunately, maintaining it takes real time and resources.

If community funding isn't enough, a paid LTS (Long-Term Support) option is being considered. If you're using this in a serious or business-critical project, please [reach out](mailto:reden@franken-ui.dev).

### What your support enables:

* Keeping it stable and compatible with browsers, Node.js, Vite, and the ever-changing JavaScript ecosystem (good luck with that)
* Regular updates of upstream dependencies so everything continues to work together smoothly
* Keeping documentation accurate and up to date
* Ensuring long-term availability and usability for everyone
* Continuing the "it just works" ethos

Thanks for your support!
