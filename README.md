## Shameless Self-Promotion

Really, inside a GitHub repo? What the heck, this is my project! Portfolio? [You're looking at it](https://franken-ui.dev). This may look like itâ€™s run by an army of devs from a company with millions in VC backing, but trust me, it's just me, Llama 3.1, and Claude.AI running the entire show!

Speaking of which, this UI is now used by solo devs, small teams, a CEO who wonâ€™t just hire a designer, and heck, even companies with millions in funding. Donâ€™t believe me? I canâ€™t either!

If you need extra brain cells, Iâ€™ve got the skills: Laravel (preferred), Vanilla PHP, JS or TS, and every framework-of-the-month in between. Note that I know nothing about Rust, Python, or Go because I'm a real programmer, so please do not send me those offers.

### Availability:

I can squeeze in 20 hours a week, or go full-time if you have the budget. I look like I'm joking, but Iâ€™m dead serious. [Let me help you translate those ideas into a successful product](mailto:reden@franken-ui.dev)!
